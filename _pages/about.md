I am Legrand Jones II, a current graduate student in math under Professor Ayelet Lindenstrauss at Indiana University. I am particularly interested in algebraic topology, techniques/ideas related to homological algebra, and (very broadly) category theory. Also a big fan of physical and digital games! 

Slightly more specifically my current focus is on THH. Recently I have also become interested in mathematical formalization/proof assistants.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
